__Wilhelm__ is a webservice for proxying the _concurrent_ API requests on
[QubitPi/Kugelblitz](https://kugelblitz.qubitpi.org/) and [QubitPi/Horten](https://horten.qubitpi.org/) so that any
business operation is executed in one atomic request.

ðŸš€ Quick Start
--------------

```console
docker run -d -it -p 8080:8080 jack20191124/wilhelm
```

A healthcheck is right at your service:

```console
$ curl -v localhost:8080/health

...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

Development
-----------

```console
make run
```

A sanity-check of `curl -v localhost:8080/health` should tell us the webservice is up and running:

```console
$ curl -v localhost:8080/health

...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```
